# Face_detection_lock
This project is a iot based project done on a raspberry pi 

The Language chosen for coding is PYTHON3

# The iot modules that you will require will be 

- 1.raspberry pi4
- 2.solenoid lock
- 3.5V 2A AC to DC adapter
- 4.Relay module
- 5.jumper wire

It has a very high accuracy and the only downside is low lighting accuracy decreases

It even uses an api to send bullet notification to the users phone when the lock is unlocked to give a extra layer of security 

# Next update
to use a ir sensor to detect depth of face and to increase the lowlight accuracy
